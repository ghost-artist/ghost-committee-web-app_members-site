          <h1>SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATION FOR GHOST ARTISTS</h1>
          <b>Due by 2/25/25</b>
        </div>

        <p>
          GHOST has up to five (5) $100 scholarships available for artists that
          require financial assistance with their membership. These can be new,
          returning or emerging artists. There is a limit of one scholarship per
          artist and they are only eligible for this one time. If two or more
          artists are involved with making one product, they are eligible for
          only one scholarship in total. If two artists live in the same
          household but make different products and pay separate artist fees,
          then they are eligible for one scholarship per person.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GHOST board will evaluate the applications and decide which ones
          to approve, based on the merit of the application answers. The board
          reserves the right to not fulfill all 5 scholarships if suitable
          artist candidates are not identified. If more than 5 suitable artists
          apply for these scholarships, then a random drawing from applicants
          will be held to award the scholarships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any artist receiving a scholarship must actively volunteer on their
          committee. If they receive a scholarship but donâ€™t fulfill their
          responsibilities to their committee, they will be unable to
          participate in future tours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Approved scholarships will be applied to your contract payment section
          via a coupon code that you would receive by 3/1/25. Apply this coupon
          code to your contract payment section. Be sure to submit your contract
          along with the rest of your artist fees by the due date of March 2.
