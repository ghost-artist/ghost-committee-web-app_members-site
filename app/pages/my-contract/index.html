                    This contract, along with all required images and electronic payment, are due on or before March 2, 2025.

                    <u><strong>I hereby agree:</strong></u>

                    - My studio is either within the boundaries of the GHOST tour map OR I will be sharing studio space
                    with another artist

                    - To open my studio display during the hours of 10AM to 5PM on September 19, 20 and 21, 2025, and be
                    present during those hours.

                    - To have current, original, one-of-a-kind artwork prominently displayed at GHOST.

                    - To abide by restrictions on commercial reproductions: less prominent placement, clear and accurate
                    labeling as a reproduction. Any item sold at GHOST must be from artist’s own images.

                    - To show visitors my workspace and demonstrate my techniques on works-in-progress. I will make my
                    process visible in a way that will enable visitors to learn more about my art form. Hosted artists
                    must comply with all the above except workspace.

                    - To serve as an active participant on one of the designated committees that help to produce the Tour.
                    All artists, even those that live outside of the tour boundaries, are expected to sign up for a
                    volunteer position on one of our committees.

                    - Attend all general meetings held to disseminate information and organize a smooth-running tour.

                    - I understand that: If another artist hosts me, he/she must be a qualified GHOST participant and I
                    cannot invite non-member artists to show work in my studio.

                    - Alcoholic beverages will not be offered if refreshments are provided at my studio.

                    - Artists who need insurance coverage for their artwork need to look into a homeowner’s or business
                    insurance policy.

                    - Participant agrees to hold harmless Gig Harbor Open Studio Tour, Studio Tour Board, participating
                    artists, and participating studio owners from all claims, demands, actions and causes of action for
                    any and all injuries or damage to or theft of artwork displayed and any personal property brought to
                    the Tour. The artist assumes all risk of loss or damage to the artist’s property.

                    - If the tour needs to be canceled due to unforeseeable circumstances, the refund amount will depend
                    on the bills & payments already made for tour requirements.

                    - If I cancel from the tour for any reason after the last day to approve changes to our brochure,
                    there is no refund.

                    - If I fail to comply with the Gig Harbor Open Studio Tour Guidelines and the conditions listed
                    herein, including not fulfilling my committee responsibilities, I will be ineligible for subsequent
                    GHOST Events.

                    <u><strong> I agree to participate in the following GHOST Timeline:</strong></u>

                        Please upload the following required digital images (jpg files of about 2-3 MB.)  All images must have a professional appearance.  2D artwork must be cropped so that matting/framing does not show in the image.

                        This image should be one of the three images that you submitted above, but cropped so that it’s square.  
                        Label like this example:  DonSmithBrochure.jpg  
                        -   If you are having trouble figuring out how to submit your digital images, contact (put Artist Images chair contact info here.)

                    <b>Sharing studios:</b>  Please note that we would like to encourage artists to share studio space where possible since these studios will get the most visitors! Our goal is to have at least 2 artists per studio – more, if possible.  Shared studio space could include garages and indoor spaces.

                    Fill out this questionnaire to help us gather information about studio sharing.
